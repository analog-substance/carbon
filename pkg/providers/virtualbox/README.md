VirtualBox is an easy-to-use virtualization solution. It is also free. It is typically installed on your computer and allows you to create virtual machines for testing. Because of this, certain Carbon features will be static.

This provider is a simple wrapper around `vbox-manage`. If that is installed, it will allow you to interact with your VMs using Carbon.
